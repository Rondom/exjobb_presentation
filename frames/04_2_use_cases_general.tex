        \begin{itemize}
            \item Userspace networking
            \item Network simulations
            \item Unikernels
            \item Development: use space tools are more widely-available and more mature
            \item Profiling
            \item Fuzzing
        \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Userspace networking and network simulations. TCP connection parameters
            \item Unikernels, i.e. you link your application again LKL. For the host operations you have the bare metal. One binary blob.
            \item Development: Use space tools are widely-available mature, easier to user
            \item Fuzzing filesystem and network stack, trying inputs, resetting expensive with VMS
        \end{itemize}
