        \begin{itemize}
            \item loopback-mounting of raw image
            \item converting CRAFF to VHD/raw image
            \item CRAFF-FS (experimental, Intel-only, provides "filesystem" with one raw-image file)
            \item mtools
            \item (Simics-externfs (developed inside the Intel SAE / zsim-project))
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item loopback-mounting
            \item convert back and forth between raw or VHD
            \item CRAFF-FS
            \begin{itemize}
                \item FS with one image file
                \item experimental, Intel-only tech preview
                \item single-threaded, maybe room for optimization
            \end{itemize}
            \item mtools CLI-utils, accessing FAT
            \item Simics-externfs
            \begin{itemize}
                \item project for DARPA. Simics + zsim
                \item externfs = retrieve files while the system is running without agent or NW, integrated into simics command line
            \end{itemize}
