    \frametitle{Motivation}
    
    File systems are complex code bases (ext4:~50~KLOC)
    
    Security bugs are a risk and most file systems run in kernel space.

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Everyone uses FS store files on laptops and mobiles
            \item lot of features, journaling, snapshots, raid, encryption
            \item ext4, common Linux-FS 50 KLOC, btrfs: 130KLOC
            \item security bugs (and other bugs) are a risk
            \item run in kernel space, that means with highest privileges
            \item Once you have code execution there, control over the whole system
        \end{itemize}
