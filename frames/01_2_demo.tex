    Demo: Let's connect that USB drive...

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pray to the demo gods...
            \item This is a console to another system
            \item and I have USB-cable with blue light to that system. \textbf{Don't buy those. It is NOT useful}
            \item My excuse is that I was 15 when I thought it was a wise idea to spend my pocket money on such things.
            \item Anyways... So I will connect this USB drive...
            \item ... and we crash.
            \item in this case is "just" NP deref
            \item could be more serious like use-after-free, out-of-bounds-write \textbf{=> code exec}

            
        \end{itemize}
