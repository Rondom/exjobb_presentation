    Demo: Let's connect that USB drive...

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pray to the demo gods...
            \item So this is blue light, and a USB cable, leading to a separate machine
            \item When I was 15, I thought it was a good idea to spend my pocket money on USB-cables with blue light.
            \item I realised that it is not very useful investment well I before I turned 16, so don't buy them
            \item Anyways... So I will connect this USB drive...
            \item NP deref, could be use-after-free, out-of-bounds-write...
