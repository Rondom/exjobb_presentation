	\begin{itemize}
		\item routing and encryption of messages in a MIX-network like manner => disguise who generates and who accesses content
		\item "Encoding for Censorship-Resistant Sharing" provides plausible deniability and
robustness
		\item variety of different transport protocols: TCP, UDP, Bluetooth
		\item applications: file-sharing, name service, telephony, IP-networking
	\end{itemize}
	
	\note{
		\begin{tiny}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item works by exchanging messages between peers (bootstapped, darknet)
				\item in a MIX-network-like fashion i.e. messages are encrypted and routed over many different peers in order to disguise who gens and accesses content
				\item messages are mixed with others and only sent out when there are enough other messages. PAUSE!
				\item security from the mixing done by their component mixes
				\item Onion routing networks get their security from choosing routes that are difficult for the adversary to observe
				\item mix-nets provide stronger protection against an attacker having control over the whole nw (source, dest, all nodes)
				\item may or may not use route unpredictability to enhance security 
				\item Plausible deniability => can claim ignorance of the transferred content due to encryption, so it is difficult for them to be held responsible.
				\item even for someone who monitors the whole network
				\item Robustness: intermediaries can (despite the encryption) verify the validity of responses with respect to query prohibiting wilful tampering
				\item economic model: reject msgs from peers of least trust
				\item ==> flooding not possible
				\item modularity
				\item different transports (TCP, UDP, HTTPS or even SMTP (i.e. E-Mails), Wireless LAN or Bluetooth)
				\item notable applications (e.g. mention that GNUnet conv relies on GNS as an example of modularity)
