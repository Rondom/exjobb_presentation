\frametitle{Contribution: Implementation work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ported LKL CLI-utilities for FS manipulation to Windows
    \item ported lklfuse to Windows and brought it to production quality on Linux
    \item[$\Rightarrow$] We can now mount any filesystem supported by the Linux Kernel under Windows
    \item created an proof-of-concept backend for libguestfs based on LKL
%    \item tried to port libguestfs to Windows (time was too short to accomplish that)
    %\item \textbf{TODO: ??? Add architecture diagram of lklfuse and libguestfs-lkl-fuse here }
\end{itemize}

\note{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item So what did I do? LKL and libguestfs work only on Linux
        \item ported LKL- CLI utils to Windows (copyto/from)
        \item lklfuse for Windows (port) using Dokan Library (equiv to libfuse) and improved quality on Linux
        \item libguestfs LKL backend. instead of using a VM, guestfsd is using LKL to access FS
        %\item tried to port libguestfs to Windows (time was too short to accomplish that)
    \end{itemize}
