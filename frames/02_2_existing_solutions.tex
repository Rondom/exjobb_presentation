                    \item mounting VHD/VHDX
                    \item ImDisk (mounts a raw FS-image as a volume)

                    \item CLI-utilities (e.g mtools)
                    \item alternative drivers (kernel and FUSE)
                    \item devio.exe (like NBD, but different protocol)

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item loopback/VHD mounting, ImDisk (Open Source)  => FS access, but limited to host FS drivers
            \item CLI-utilities (mtools, ltools) => non-uniform interface, re-implementation, less-proven code
            \item NBD, There is FUSE/CUSE but no block device in user space, NBD (could?) fill the gap. Used to mount image formats such as Qemu's qcow2. Windows equivalent is open-source devio.exe (comes with ImDisk)
            \item alternative drivers may lack the stability and feature-set of mature implementations
            \item \textbf{Only libguestfs offers wide-FS support under a uniform interface. Goal: re-use OS-level code!}
