    \begin{block}{Goal:}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item provide CLI and native FS access on both Windows and Linux
        \item uniform interface, regardless of file system type
        \item provide support for file systems not supported by the host OS
        \item keep extensibility in mind with regards to file systems supported
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item provide CLI and native FS access on both Windows and Linux
            \item uniform interface, regardless of file system type
            \item not only FS supported by host
            \item re-use existing implementations, keep extensibility in mind
        \end{itemize}
    }
