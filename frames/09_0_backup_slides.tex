            \item like it here
            \item learned a lot
            \item scope was too wide, lklfuse + utils would have been enough
            \item could have asked for help more often
            \item thank everyone who made me feel welcome, gave advice, talked Swedish with me even if it was a bit of a hassle
            \item learned to work in Sweden
