\frametitle{Evaluation: The How}
\begin{itemize}
    \item challenge: find balance between evaluating for our use case and general applicability
    \item focus on synthetic benchmarks for a start, fits the use case of exchanging a few files
    \item using extensive suite of existing benchmarks (Filebench) not possible due to missing Windows support
    \item to be expected that performance will be worse under real-world workloads
\end{itemize}

\note{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item challenge: find balance between evaluating for our use case (mounting images) and general applicability (mounting disks, production use)
        \item There exists only one good paper evaluating FUSE performance
        \item would have been really nice to reproduce the results of that paper in addition and in comparison to LKL-based file systems
        \item focus on synthetic benchmarks for a start, fits the use case of exchanging one or two files
        \item to be expected that performance will be worse under real-world workloads
        \item What:
        \begin{tiny}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item RAM reduced to 4GB, 16 GB file size, empty Ext4 FS of  33 GB
            \item Linux: loopback-mounting, LKL-FUSE, libguestfs-KVM, libguestfs-LKL
            \item Windows: LKL-FUSE (Dokany), VHD with NTFS
        \end{itemize}.
        \end{tiny}
    \end{itemize}
