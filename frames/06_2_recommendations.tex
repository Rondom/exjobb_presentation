\frametitle{Recommendations and Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
    \item simplify the documentation on loopback mounting
    \item port SimicsFS to Windows using Dokan
    \item enable on-the-fly access to CRAFF-images from the host using CRAFF-FS (FUSE) or some other technique like NBDkit
    \item link CRAFF-FS to Dokan-FUSE and expose a VHD for mounting on Windows
    \item make the libguestfs-appliance run on Simics
    \item enable downloading of debug-symbols from the target using checkpointing and/or some of the technologies presented
\end{itemize}

\note{
\begin{itemize}
    \item simplify the documentation on loopback mounting (currently involves running parted and calculating offsets)
    \item port SimicsFS to Windows using Dokan or another FUSE library
    \item enable on-the-fly access to CRAFF-images from the host using CRAFF-FS (FUSE) or some other technique like NBDkit
    \item link CRAFF-FS to Dokan-FUSE and expose a VHD for mounting on Windows
