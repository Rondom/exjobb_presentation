        \begin{itemize}
            \item Mounting filesystem images without root-access
            \item Manipulating files without mounting (CLI or library)
            \item Re-using well-tested drivers from Linux in other OSes or bootloaders
            \item Mounting untrusted filesystems (in the future, no good isolation, yet)
            \item Use LKL for mounting filesystem types with a bad security record
        \end{itemize}
