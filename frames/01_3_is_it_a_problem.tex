            \item<3-> There are easier ways: ask user to execute file, BadUSB...
            \item<3-> Robustness of filesystems regarding the on-disk-format has at least historically not been a priority .

        \begin{itemize}
            \item<4-> Compromising unattended PC with lock screen
            \item<4-> Connecting untrusted USB disks
            \item<4-> Double-clicking filesystem images (depends on configuration)

            \item There are easier ways: asking user to execute funny\_joke.exe,
            \item or BadUSB (if you don't know it, look it up), looks like a memory stick or even charging cable, but is a keyboard sending keystrokes
            \item \textbf{but where is it a problem:} Unattended PC with lock screen
            \item Connecting untrusted USB disks
            \item Double-clicking filesystem images (depends on configuration)
            \item Moving data from an Air-Gapped machines, i.e. machines without nw-conn
