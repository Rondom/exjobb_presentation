            \item<2-> It depends...
            \item<3-> There are easier ways to compromise a system: social engineering, BadUSB...
            \item<3-> But robustness in the face of a corrupted on-disk filesystem image has at least historically not been a priority

        \begin{itemize}
            \item<4-> Compromising unattended PC with lock screen
            \item<4-> Connecting untrusted USB disks
            \item<4-> Double-clicking filesystem images (depends on configuration)
