	\frametitle{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item good framework for experimenting  and researching one secure, anonymous, censorhsip-resitant technology
		\item not very user-friendly
		\item security valued over latency
		\item does not help against "rubberhose cryptanalysis"
	\end{itemize}

	\note{
		\begin{itemize}
			\item good for research, master or PHD => TUM, INRIA (institute for CS in france)
			\item posted list of beginners tasks (also non-programming tasks like SELinux or apparmor policies)
			\item lack of polish, difficult to setup
			\item security over latency... to the point were even patient people might argue whether it is usable at all
			\item interesting to play around with
		\end{itemize}
