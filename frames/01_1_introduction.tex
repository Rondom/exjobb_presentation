    \frametitle{Introduction}
    
    Virtual machines are widely used for development.

    Exchanging files while the guest (VM) running is not always feasible or possible, e.g. when...
    \begin{itemize}
        \item bootstrapping a new guest
        \item the guest not having any support for networking
        \item the guest is paused during debugging
    \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item VM enable a single host hardware to run multiple different guest OS isolated from another.
            \item widely used for dev
            \item exchanging files done while VM is running using NW or hypervisor-specific tools
            \item online not always feasible or possible
            \begin{itemize}
                \item bootstrapping a new guest (exchanging executable using a script)
                \item no networking or HV-specific support is available on the target (BIOS development)
                \item Don't mention debugging
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    }
