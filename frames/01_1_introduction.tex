    \frametitle{Introduction}
    
    There is room for improvement in existing methods of offline file system access in terms of feature-set and ease-of-use.

    Accessing files while the simulation is running is not always feasible or possible, e.g. when...
    \begin{itemize}
        \item bootstrapping a new guest
        \item neither Simics Agent nor networking is available on the target
        \item debugging (for downloading symbols)
    \end{itemize}



    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item room for improvement
            \item online not always feasible or possible
            \begin{itemize}
                \item bootstrapping a new guest (exchanging executable using a script)
                \item no Simics Agent or networking is available on the target
                \item debugging: getting debugging symbols
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    }
