    \frametitle{Outlook on Future Work}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item LKLFUSE (me):
            \begin{itemize}
                \item currently working on: better performance and more correct behaviour using libfuse3  and low-level API
                \item Future: integration, running under less privileged account, maybe use seccomp-bpf...
            \end{itemize}

        \item Other developments in progress:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Mainlining
                \item KASAN support
                \item Support for multiple processes (fork)
            \end{itemize}
        
    \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pray to the demo gods...
            \item So this is blue light, and a USB cable, leading to a separate machine
            \item When I was 15, I thought it was a good idea to spend my pocket money on USB-cables with blue light.
            \item I realised that it is not very useful investment well I before I turned 16, so don't buy them
            \item Anyways... So I will connect this USB drive...
            \item NP deref, could be use-after-free, out-of-bounds-write...
            
        \end{itemize}
