\frametitle{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ported LKL CLI-utilities for FS manipulation to Windows
    \item ported lklfuse to Windows and brought it to (near-)production quality on Linux
    \item[$\Rightarrow$] We can now mount any filesystem supported by the Linux Kernel under Windows
    \item created an experimental backend for libguestfs based on LKL
    \item tried to port libguestfs to Windows (time was too short to accomplish that)
    %\item \textbf{TODO: ??? Add architecture diagram of lklfuse and libguestfs-lkl-fuse here }
\end{itemize}

\note{
\begin{tiny}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item So, what did \textbf{I} do (besides evaluating)?
        \item ported LKL-utils
        \item lklfuse for Windows and Linux
        \begin{tiny}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \tiny{]can now handle load (LKL is limited to 32/64 syscall threads and those threads were not freed...). Took two attempts to get right. Now the limit has been raised to 1024 / 4096 threads upstream}
            \item \tiny{large file support (Did you know how Kernel >= 2.6 handle LFS?). I needed to find out by stepping from the VFS-layer to EXT4 to MM...}
            \item resource leaks on Windows
            \item \tiny{bugfixes in Dokan-FUSE (e.g. rmdir a directory with files in it => returned success even though it was not deleted)}
            \item \tiny{using command-line-arguments to enable caching, bigger writes}
        \end{itemize}
        \end{tiny}
        \item libguestfs LKL backend: quick and dirty implementation, too slow for practical use, needs further investigation


        \begin{itemize}
            \item \tiny{how to port the code from using open() to lkl\_sys\_open()? Looked into objcopy, coccinelle, manual editing, ifdefs. Ended up doing many \#defines}
            \item \tiny{Even the original qemu-KVM is very slow, and so is the LKL-port.}
            \item \tiny{A maintainable solution needs to be found to implement this code-wise}
        \end{itemize}

        \item tried to port libguestfs to Windows (time was too short to accomplish that)
    \end{itemize}
