\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item LKL delivers acceptable performance for the use case of exchanging files from disk images
    \item more evaluation and optimizations needed for more general-purpose use
    \item libguestfs is a very useful toolset in its current form
    \item implementing a backend for libguestfs requires a lot of work
    \item time was too short to implement, port and evaluate LKL-FUSE, libguestfs and libguestfs-lkl under both Windows and Linux
\end{itemize}
