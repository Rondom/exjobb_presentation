\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item LKLFUSE delivers acceptable performance for the use case of exchanging files from disk images on Linux
    \item LKLFUSE on Windows is held back by the lack of good userspace FS library
    \item more evaluation and optimizations needed for more general-purpose use
    \item dedicated command-line utilities deliver higher performance but depending on the use case a worse user experience
    \item libguestfs is a very useful toolset in its current form, but is best used from command-line
    \item time was too short to analyse the results in detail
\end{itemize}

\note{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item LKL delivers acceptable performance for the use case of exchanging files from disk images
    \item LKLFUSE on Windows is held back by the lack of good userspace FS library
    \item More evaluations and optimizations are needed for more general-purpose use
    \item Use dedicated tools for performance, FUSE for usability
    \item libguestfs is a very useful toolset in its current form wrt. to its feature-set
    \item libguestfs architecture not suited for FUSE use case or LKL
