\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item LKL delivers acceptable performance for the use case of exchanging files from disk images
    \item more evaluation and optimizations needed for more general-purpose use
    \item dedicated command-line utilities deliver higher performance but a worse user experience
    \item libguestfs is a very useful toolset in its current form
    \item implementing a backend for libguestfs requires a lot of work
    \item time was too short to implement, port and evaluate LKL-FUSE, libguestfs and libguestfs-lkl under both Windows and Linux
\end{itemize}

\note{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item LKL delivers acceptable performance for the use case of exchanging files from disk images
    \item Even with SSDs, CPU-speed has increased at a higher pace than storage speed over the years
    \item More evaluations and optimizations are needed for more general-purpose use
    \item Use dedicated tools for performance, FUSE for usability
    \item libguestfs is a very useful toolset in its current form wrt. to its feature-set
    \item implementing a backend for libguestfs requires a lot of work
    \item time was too short to implement, port and evaluate LKL-FUSE, libguestfs and libguestfs-lkl under both Windows and Linux

    \end{itemize}
